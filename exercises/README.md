Exercises
=============

From complete beginner to novice level, you should find some exercises here to interest and challenge you.

Each exercise lives in a self-contained directory.  Exercise directories contain at least one exercise file
and one solution file.  Some may contain an assets directory that pertain to the exercise.  There is often
more than one way to solve a problem in programming, hence it will not be unusual to discover more than
one solution file for an exercise.

If you would like to contribute your own solution to an exercise for others to learn from, please open a pull
request (and ensure you follow the nomenclature guidelines).

Nomenclature Guidelines
=======================

Directory and file names have the following format:

L3_DescriptiveNameCategoryName.php

The letter 'L' at the beginning stands for 'Level' and is followed by a number from 1 to 5 denoting the
perceived difficulty of the exercise.
